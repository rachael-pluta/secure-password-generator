# Secure Password Generator

## Description
The purpose of this project was to create a secure password generator for employees with access to sensitive data.

The password generator requires the employee to select the length of the password, and whether they want upper case, lower case, numbers and/or symbols.

This project set the foundation for my understanding of JavaScript and how it can be used to create interactive web applications.

## Usage
You can click on the generate button, which displays prompts in relation to the length of your desired password and the types of characters you would like to include.

If the user wants a password that does not meet the desired length (ie. between 8 and 128 characters), an error message will display:
